		<h3>After high school, I plan to go to the college UCSD or even Cal Poly San Luis Oispo to
  double major in mathematics and computer or mechanical engineering. I also plan to swim in
  collge to keep myself active. Right now, I swim for my club team, called Chino Hills Aquatics,
  and for my high school, Ruben S. Ayala High School, on the varsity team. Some of my hobbies are
  to mess around with my little brother, play video games, and hnag out with my friends.</h3>
