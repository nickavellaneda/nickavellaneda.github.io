		<p>This is the project from when I first started messing around with scratch. 
		I started by finding some stuff that I found funny. I then added the function which added 
		the clones to the picture when I pressed on the up arrow. I also made it to where the character 
		spins for a longer distance.</p>

		<p>To be honest, the concept of this seemed really tough at first. After a while of playing throuh some of the schematics, I got the hang
			of how to utilize the variables and programs. I tried to base the game off of a legend of zelda theme. My partner, Kamryn Areguin,
			helped come up with the concepts and she also was a big help with the backlog. Our backlog can be found below.</p>

		<p>At first, I didn't know what I wanted to do the project on; thus, I decided to do the project on the subject that was most interesting at the time,
		which happened to be U.S. History. The story is based on the California Gold Rush and how a city could have been made during the time.
		My partner, Matthew Luis helped me out a lot with the flow chart.<p>

		<p>To make things interesting, my partner Ajay and I decided to create solitaire for the python project. 
		To be honest, it was amazingly hard to find out how to make the game first. After a couple days, we started to 
		figure put what we needed to accomplish first and soon the project was done! Click on the picture to play. </p>
